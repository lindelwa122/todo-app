# Commit Rules

1. Commit every time you make a meaningful change in the code.

2. Provide a subject that specifies your code's action.

3. Limit the subject line to 50 characters.

4. Capitalize the subject line.

5. Do not end the subject with a period.

6. Use the imperative mood in the subject line.

   - Imperative means spoken or written as if giving a command or instruction.
   - Eg.

     ```
     Fixed a bug on... -> wrong

     Fix a bug on... -> correct
     ```

7. Seperate the subject from body with a blank line.

8. Wrap the body at 72 characters.

9. Use the body to explain _what_ and _why_ vs _how_.

10. Avoid using vague commit messages such as _'saved'_ or _'updated'_.
