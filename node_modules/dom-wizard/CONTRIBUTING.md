# Contributing Rules

1. We have adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as our Code of Conduct, and we expect project participants to adhere to it. Please read the [full text](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

2. Any kind of contribution is welcome and appreciated but small contributions like fixing grammatical errors, punctuations, and typos won't count for Hacktoberfest.

3. If you find a bug, open an issue. Before filing a new issue, try to make sure your problem doesn’t already exist.

4. A bug fix should maintain the existing function's behavior, ensuring it remains backward compatible and does not break any code relying on it.

5. If you decide to fix an issue or work on a feature, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is already working on it. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people don’t accidentally duplicate your effort.

6. If somebody claims an issue but doesn’t follow up for more than a week, it’s fine to take it over but you should still leave a comment.

7. Ensure your code aligns with our style guide, if you are not sure about something check the [Airbnb's style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

8. It's okay to work on features/issues that are not mentioned on the [features list](https://github.com/lindelwa122/dom-manipulation-library#features) or [issues tab](https://github.com/lindelwa122/dom-manipulation-library/issues). Just please leave a comment stating what you are going to work on.

9. Read [this](/VERSIONING.md) to understand how we handle `versioning`.

10. Every significant change is documented in the [documentation file](/DOCUMENTATION.md).

11. To discuss more ideas, contact me [here](https://github.com/lindelwa122/dom-manipulation-library#contact).
